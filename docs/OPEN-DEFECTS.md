# GridIron IQ Open Defects

> **Status:** CURRENT DEFECT INDEX. Updated 2026-09-11.

> This file indexes unresolved coach-observed defects and investigations. Detail

## Reports

1. **OLL live-data audit - REPAIRED, awaiting Codex re-review and a Charlie
   Gate.** All ten items plus one found in passing are closed in code across
   the commits beginning `d3c71e6`, with three further repairs from Codex's
   2026-09-10 review. Detail, reconciliation and mutation evidence are in
   `docs/REPORTS-OLL-LIVE-AUDIT-2026-09-10.md`; the production decision record
   is `design-comps/reports-oll-repairs-2026-09-10/RATIONALE.md`. No surface
   advanced past `REJECTED`, and no installed WebView2 smoke has been run
   against these repairs, so none of it is accepted state.

   **Codex review round 1, repaired 2026-09-10:**
   - Player return production now uses the team report's measured-return
     cohort for the COUNT as well as the yardage. `Ret` printed every return
     event beside measured yards and a measured average.
   - Defensive `Yds / play` divides by the classified run/pass cohort its own
     numerator comes from. The approved `2.9` was a value in a comp fixture,
     not an approved formula; the honest figure is `3.2`.
   - The Self-Scout HTML export prints the board's schema: `_ddPretty` labels,
     a dash in every measured cell of a held row, and a defensive KPI band
     that leads with Yards Allowed / Play and ends with Stop Rate.

   **Two questions still carried to the coach, deliberately not decided:**
   - Deleting Stop Rate outright from the Self-Scout KPI band or Overview's
     Defense & discipline module would change an approved row count. It was
     moved out of the headline position instead; both compositions keep six
     slots.
   - Four OLL plays (ids 63, 67, 76, 90 - two sacks, a pass, a run) carry no
     `unit` tag, and punt distance, hang time and return yardage are
     essentially uncharted across the season. Both are charting-workflow gaps
     raised for the coach; nothing was inferred or written back.

   **Codex review follow-up, repaired 2026-09-10:** Defensive production
   `Snaps`, Total Yds and Yds / play now use one CLASSIFIED cohort and reconcile
   arithmetically. The complete sample remains available as explicitly named
   `charted` data for call-frequency calculations and sample disclosure.
2. **Renamed HTML report does not open correctly after save.** Reproduced by the
   coach for both Defense Report and Game Report. Keeping the default filename
   works; changing it during the native save flow does not. Treat this as a
   shared export-delivery defect until investigation proves otherwise. Preserve
   the chosen path and extension; do not guess the cause from the symptom.
3. **HTML report presentation needs redesign.** The current exported report is
   not visually acceptable. This is lower-priority product work, separate from
   the renamed-file functional defect and not permission to change the approved
   in-app dashboard composition.
4. **Defense Situational Results has broken vertical rhythm.** The Down &
   Distance and Field Zone modules leave visible unused space instead of fitting
   their declared static rows cleanly. The board currently combines fixed module
   heights (`338px` and `225px`) with separately fixed header and row heights;
   their totals do not reconcile at the observed viewport. Preserve the static
   dashboard schema, but make its row, header, padding and module-height math
   explicit and exact rather than allowing data volume to resize the board.
5. **Reports typography accepted by the coach; Breakdown reflow repaired in
   source, awaiting installed confirmation.** The shared semantic floor is now
   12.5px for labels, 13px for controls and 13.5px for body copy. Defense tabs,
   section and module titles, table headers, dense formation headers, KPI
   evidence and direction labels now use readable IBM Plex Sans roles with
   zero tracking. Breakdown route controls, theater metadata, play cards and
   charting-rail controls follow the same hierarchy. Condensed remains reserved
   for page identity and prominent football numbers. The coach accepted the
   larger Reports typography in isolation. Installed Breakdown showed that its
   older narrow play-browser and charting columns were not reflowed around the
   larger type; the route-scoped source correction is recorded below.

## Breakdown

1. **Delete play - REPAIRED 2026-09-10.** `PlayTagger.deleteCurrentPlay()` read
   `id` before assigning it. It now captures `currentPlayId` before any delete
   logic. `e2e-native-breakdown-theater` exercises the rendered button through
   confirmation and proves that exactly the selected play is removed and the
   adjacent play becomes current.
2. **Reconnect notice obscures lower tagging controls.** Confirmed against a
   read-only OLL browser copy at both 1440 and 1280. The persistent notice sits
   over lower tagging content and actions. Open visual repair; do not alter its
   migration guidance until its lifecycle and owning component are identified.
3. **Breakdown reports contradictory film state.** On the same OLL render, the
   shell says `No film selected` while a persistent notice says 89 clips need
   reconnection. Open state-ownership investigation; the canonical OLL data has
   83 unique plays, 83 unique charted clip ids, and 89 playlist entries.
4. **Play-card result labels truncate.** The 1440 OLL play strip clips visible
   results including `Gain + Touchdown` and `Penalty + Loss`. Full text remains
   in accessible labels/tooltips, but the visible presentation is incomplete.
   Open visual repair against the accepted Breakdown composition.
5. **Wide Breakdown columns were sized for the retired compact type.** At a
   1920px CSS viewport the play browser received about 288px and the charting
   rail about 461px. With the accepted readable font floor, both columns crowd
   their real labels. The route-scoped correction widens them without changing
   Reports typography or the shared token floor; installed confirmation remains
   required.

## Deferred Beta Maintenance

1. **Visual regression coverage is weaker than its release language.** Current
   Chromium harnesses prove behavior, minimum font sizes and containment, but
   they do not compare populated production screens with the approved captures
   or certify installed WebView2 rendering. Add mutation-verified visual
   baselines for representative real-data screens when the beta workflow can
   absorb the maintenance cost.
2. **Shared typography-token changes need explicit cross-surface review.** A
   token edit can alter every route while a focused harness remains green.
   Until broader visual automation exists, keep presentation repairs scoped to
   the owning route where possible and inspect affected surfaces before calling
   an installer visually accepted.

## Release Impact

- `1.12.0-77` is an ungated local handoff and is not accepted.
- Current Home and every Reports surface remain `REJECTED` in the design
  approval registry even though `1.12.0-70` remains the last accepted installed
  release snapshot.
- Do not package or promote until the active repair scope has been reviewed,
  gated at the required tier, and smoked in installed WebView2.
